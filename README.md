This is a program for composing and producing experimental electronic music, with an emphasis on freedom from conventional tonal and rhythmic structures and the ability to forge one's own path in that regard.

It requires the ability to run programs in both Pd and Python (simultaneously). A basic understanding of music theory and music technology is also helpful.

Dependencies are:
>= Pd vanilla 0.55.0
>= Python 3.13.0
>= Tkinter 8.6.14

It is currently in the experimental phase and in active development. I am running it on MacOS 14.6.1. Performance on other operating systems is not currently known.

To run:
- Open Pd and configure audio settings as needed
- Run pd/compose-orchestra.pd
- Run main.py

More detailed instructions forthcoming, but basically, you compose by clicking on the canvas to create notes, and use the entry boxes to change parameters. When you're ready to hear what you've made, click the "print" button in the lower left corner or hit shift+return to print your "score". Then navigate to the Pd window and click "start" to hear your piece performed.
